## :wave: Intro
This repository extract scenarios and features from highway trajectory dataset (e.g., exid, highD, NGSIM datasets preprocessed using https://github.com/SajjadMzf/TrajPreprocess) required for training trajectory prediction models. Following are some pre-implemented scenarios/feature lists:

- Feature sets for several papers: MMNTP[1], POVL[2], EarlyLCPred [3], Wirthmuller et. al[4] and CS-LSTM[5].
- Time-to-lane-change calculation
- scenarios with labelled manouevres (lane change and lane keeping)
- Rendering bird's eye view images from extracted scenarios.
- Export datasets in hdf5 format.
- Support for multiple trajectory datasets (highD, exiD, NGSIM, and etc)
